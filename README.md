This is a fullstack application

## Project description
In this project we upload and download files (images) on/from a react front end application.
We use Spring Boot for the backend and Amazon S3 to store files (images).
For the front end you will use react and hooks.

This application allows you store any files that you can think of, a common feature that most applications have.
Whether its a web app or mobile app, what you will build will allow any client to upload files.
